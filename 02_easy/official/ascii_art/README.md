# ASCII Art

## The Goal

### Rules

ASCII art allows you to represent forms by using characters. To be precise, in
our case, these forms are words. For example, the word _MANHATTAN_ could be
displayed as follows in ASCII art:

<pre style="color:#FFFFFF">
    # #  #  ### # #  #  ### ###  #  ###
    ### # # # # # # # #  #   #  # # # #
    ### ### # # ### ###  #   #  ### # #
    # # # # # # # # # #  #   #  # # # #
    # # # # # # # # # #  #   #  # # # #
</pre>

Your mission is to write a program that can display a line of text in ASCII art
in a style you are given as input.

## Game Input

### Input

-   Line 1: the width **L** of a letter represented in ASCII art. All letters
    are the same width
-   Line 2: the height **H** of a letter represented in ASCII art. All letters
    are the same height
-   Line 3: The line of text **T**, composed of **N** ASCII characters
-   Following lines: the string of characters ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ?
    represented in ASCII art

### Output

-   The text **T** in ASCII art. The characters a to z are shown in ASCII art
    by their equivalent in upper case. The characters that are not in the
    intervals [a-z] or [A-Z] will be shown as a question mark in ASCII art

### Constraints

-   0 &lt; **L** &lt; 30
-   0 &lt; **H** &lt; 30
-   0 &lt; **N** &lt; 200
