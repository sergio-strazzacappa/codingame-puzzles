# Horse-Racing Duals

## The Goal

Casablanca's Hippodrome is organizing a new type of horse racing: duals. During
a dual, only two horses will participate in the race. In order for the race to
be interesting, it is necessary to try to select two horses with similar
strength.

Write a program which, using a given number of strength, identifies the two
closest strengths and shows their difference with an integer (&geq; 0).

## Game Input

### Input

-   Line 1: Number **N** of horses
-   The **N** following lines: the strength **P** of each horse. **P** is an
    integer

## Output

-   The difference **D** between the two closest strengths. **D** is an integer
    greater or equal to 0

## Constraints

-   1 &lt; **N** &lt; 100000
-   0 &lt; **P** &lt; 10000000
