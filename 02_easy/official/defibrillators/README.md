# Defibrillators

## Goal

The city of Montpellier has equipped its streets with defibrillators to help
save victims of cardiac arrests. The data corresponding to **the position of
all defibrillators** is available online.

Based on the data we provide in the tests, write a program that will allow
users to find the defibrillator nearest to their location using their mobile
phone.

## Rules

The input data you require for your program is provided in text format.

This data is comprised of lines, each of which represents a defibrillator. Each
defibrillator is represented by the following fields:

-   A number identifying the defibrillator
-   Name
-   Address
-   Contact Phone number
-   Longitude (degrees)
-   Latitude (degrees)

These fields are separated by a semicolon (**;**).

**Beware**: _the decimal numbers use the comma (**,**) as decimal separator.
Remember to turn the comma (**,**) into dot (**.**) if necessary in order to
use the data in your program._

### Distance

The distance **d** between two points **A** and **B** will be calculated using
the following formula:

x = (longitudeB - longitudeA) \* cos((latitudeA + latitudeB) / 2)

y = (latitudeB - latitudeA)

d = sqrt(x \* x + y \* y) \* 6371

_Note: In this formula, the latitudes and longitudes are expressed in radians.
6371 corresponds to the radius of the earth in km._

The program will display the name of the defibrillator located the closest to
the user’s position. This position is given as input to the program.

## Input

-   Line 1: User's longitude (in degrees)
-   Line 2: User's latitude (in degrees)
-   Line 3: The number **N** of defibrillators located in the streets of
    Montpellier
-   **N** next lines: a description of each defibrillator

## Output

-   The name of the defibrillator located the closest to the user’s position

## Constraints

-   0 &lt; **N** &lt; 10000
