# Compiler CG86 (Easy Version)

## Goal

**CG86** is a minimal arithmetic compiler targeting a fictional assembly
language. It supports only addition and subtraction, using a single register
**cgx**, initialized to zero.

To reduce the instruction count, repeated operations can be compressed using the
**REPEAT** instruction.

## Instruction Set

-   **ADD cgx X**: Adds **X** to **cgx**
-   **SUB cgx X**: Subtracts **X** from **cgx**
-   **REPEAT N**: Repeats the next instruction **N** times
-   **EXIT**: Terminates the program

The **REPEAT** instruction applies only to **identical operations** - that is,
instructions of the same type and operand (e.g. multiple instances of
**ADD cgx 5**).

The **REPEAT** instruction must come before the instruction it repeats.

Identical operations must be compressed using the **REPEAT** instruction, even
if they do not appear consecutively in the original expression.

Instructions must preserve the original order of computation and may only be
optimized using the **REPEAT** instruction. Reordering or merging of
non-identical operations is not allowed.

The program must end with an **EXIT** instruction.

## Input

-   A single line containing a space-separated arithmetic expression,
    alternating between integers and + or - operators

## Output

-   A sequence of CG86 instructions, with one instruction per line, following
    the specified order and optimization rules

## Constraints

-   The length of the input expression is less than 1024 characters
-   All numbers in the input expression are integers between 1 and 9
    (inclusive)
-   The expression is well-formed and contains at least two numbers and one
    operator
