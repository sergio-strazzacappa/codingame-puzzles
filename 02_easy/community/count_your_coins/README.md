# Count Your Coins

## Goal

You live in a world where all coins have the same shape, weight and feel. You
can't distinguish them in your pocket. Knowing how many coins of each value you
have in your pocket, how many should you grab, without looking, to be sure to
have enough money to pay?

## Input

-   Line 1: An integer **valueToReach** representing the price you want to be
    able to pay
-   Line 2: An integer **N** representing the number of different coin types you
    have
-   Line 3: **N** integers separated by space representing the number of coins
    of each type
-   Line 4: **N** integers separated by space representing the value of each
    type

## Output

-   Line 1: A line containing a single integer representing the minimum number
    of coins you need to grab to be sure to have enough money to pay. **-1** if
    there's not enough money in your pocket

## Constraints

-   1 &leq; **number of coins** &leq; 1000
-   1 &leq; **coin values** &leq; 1000
-   1 &leq; **N** &leq; 1000
