# Ghost Legs

## Goal

Ghost Legs is a kind of lottery game common in Asia. It starts with a number of
vertical lines. Between the lines there are random horizontal connectors binding
all lines into a connected diagram, like the one below.

<pre style="color:#FFFFFF">
A  B  C
|  |  |
|--|  |
|  |--|
|  |--|
|  |  |
1  2  3
</pre>

To play the game, a player chooses a line in the top and follow it downwards.
When a horizontal connector is encountered, he must follow the connector to
turn to another vertical line and continue downwards. Repeat this until reaching
the bottom of the diagram.

In the example diagram, when you start from **A**, you will end up in **2**.
Starting from **B** will end up in **1**. Starting from **C** will end up in
**3**. It is guaranteed that every top label will map to a unique bottom label.

Given a **Ghost Legs diagram**, find out which top label is connected to which
bottom label. List all connected pairs.

## Input

-   Line 1: Integer **W** and **H** for width and height of the diagram below
-   Next **H** lines: Containing a Ghost Legs diagram as your input

    -   The diagram itself is composed of characters: **|** and **-**, (and
        space)
    -   The top line in the diagram has a number of labels **T**
    -   The bottom line contains labels **B**
    -   Each **T** and **B** is a single visible _ASCII_ character that can be
        of any random value
    -   Do not assume they will always be ABC or 123.

-   As a rule of the game, left and right horizontal connectors will never
    appear at the same point
-   All diagrams are having the same style as the test cases

## Output

-   List all connected pairs between top and bottom labels, **TB**, in the order
    of the top labels **from Left to Right**. Write each pair in a separate line

## Constraints

-   3 &lt; **W**, **H** &leq; 100
-   ASCII characters used in the top and bottom labels are in range of Hex 21 to
    Hex 7E, inclusive
