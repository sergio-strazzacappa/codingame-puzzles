# Embedded Chessboards

## Goal

In a visit to a gallery I saw a contemporary art painting such that the whole
picture is full of checker-pattern tiles, with alternating squares of darker and
lighter colors (like the one in the banner). Though I was unable to appreciate
how this painting was worth the quoted dollar value, I envisioned plenty of
chessboards embedded in the pattern.

How many chessboards can be found in the painting? I was wondering.

A chessboard is defined as an area of 8x8 tiles and **MUST** have a white (or a
lighter color) tile at the bottom-right corner. The painting has its strict
orientation. One cannot rotate the painting to count nor count a rotated area as
a valid chessboard.

## Input

-   Line 1: An integer **n**, for the number of lines to follow
-   Following **n** lines: Each line is an independent test carrying three
    integers **row** **col** **isWhite**

    -   **row** is the number of rows of tiles in the painting
    -   **col** is the number of columns of tiles in the painting
    -   **isWhite** is either 0 or 1. 0 means false; 1 means true. It indicates
        whether the lower-right corner of the painting is white (or is a lighter color)

## Output

-   Write **n** lines. For each test, write an integer showing the number of
    valid chessboards that can be found in the painting

## Constraints

-   8 &leq; **row**, **col** &leq; 10000
-   1 &leq; **n** &leq; 100
