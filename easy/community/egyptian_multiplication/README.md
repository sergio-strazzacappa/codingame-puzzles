# Egyptian Multiplication

## Goal

You have to multiply two integers (`a` & `b`) by means of a method used in
Ancient Egypt, described in Rhind’s hieratic papyrus written circa −1650 by
Ahmes.

- First, sort the two numbers
- Then follow the steps below, the algorithm uses base-2 decomposition of the
  biggest number

Example: We multiply 12 by 5, here is what you have to print, except the
comments after hashes.

<pre style="color:#FFFFFF">
12 * 5

= 12 * 4 + 12       # Divide 5 by 2, 5 = 2×2+1
                      and 12*5 = 12*(2*2+1)
                               = 12*2*2+12
                               = 24*2+12

= 24 * 2 + 12       # Divide 2 by 2, 2 = 1*2+0
                      and 12*5 = 24*(1*2+0)+12
                               = 48*1+12

= 48 * 1 + 12       # Divide 1 by 2, 1 = 0*2+1
                      and 12*5 = 48*(0*2+1)+12
                               = 12+48

= 48 * 0 + 12 + 48  # End of the algorithm

= 60
</pre>

## Input

- Two integers (`a` and `b`) separated by a space

## Output

- **A number of lines**: Successive operations

## Constraints

- 0 &leq; `a`, `b` &leq; 32768
