# Horse-racing Duals

## The Goal

Casablanca's Hippodrome is organizing a new type of horse racing: duals. During
a dual, only two horses will participate in the race. In order for the race to
be interesting, it is necessary to try to select two horses with similar
strength.

Write a program which, using a given number of strength, identifies the two
closest strengths and shows their difference with an integer (&geq; 0).

## Game input

### Input

-   **Line 1**: number `N` of horses
-   **The `N` following lines**: the strength `P` of each horse. `P` is an
    integer

## Output

-   The difference `D` between the two closest strengths. `D` is an integer
    greater or equal to 0

## Constraints

-   1 &lt; `N` &lt; 100000
-   0 &lt; `P` &lt; 10000000
