# Power of Thor - Episode 1

## The Goal

Your program must allow Thor to reach the light of power.

## Rules

Thor moves on a map which is **40** wide by **18** high. Note that the
coordinates (X and Y) start at the top left! This means the most top left cell
has the coordinates _X=0,Y=0_ and the most bottom right one has the coordinates
_X=39,Y=17_.

**Once the program starts** you are given:

-   the variable `lightX`: the X position of the light of power that Thor must
    reach
-   the variable `lightY`: the Y position of the light of power that Thor must
    reach
-   the variable `initialTX`: the starting X position of Thor
-   the variable `initialTY`: the starting Y position of Thor

**At the end of the game turn**, you must output the direction in which you want
Thor to go among:

-   `N` (North)
-   `NE` (North-East)
-   `E` (East)
-   `SE` (South-East)
-   `S` (South)
-   `SW` (South-West)
-   `W` (West)
-   `NW` (North-West)

Each movement makes Thor move by 1 cell in the chosen direction.

## Victory Conditions

You win when Thor reaches the light of power

## Lose Conditions

Thor moves outside the map

## Example

-   **Initial phase**: Thor starts on the map at position (3, 6). The light is
    at position (3, 8)
-   **Round 1**: Action `S` - Thor moves towards south. New position is (3, 7)
-   **Round 2**: Action `S` - Thor moves towards south. New position is (3, 8)

## Note

_Do not forget to execute the tests from the **Test cases** panel._

**Beware**: _the tests given and the validators used to compute the score are
slightly different in order to avoid hard coded solutions._

## Game Input

-   The program must first read the initialization data from the standard input,
    then, in an infinite loop, provides on the standard output the instructions
    to move Thor.

### Initialization Input

-   **Line 1**: 4 integers `lightX` `lightY` `initialTX` `initialTY`.
    (lightX, lightY) indicates the position of the light. (initialTX, initialTY)
    indicates the initial position of Thor

### Input For A Game Round

-   **Line 1**: the number of remaining moves for Thor to reach the light of
    power `remainingTurns`. You can ignore this data but you must read it

### Output For A Game Round

-   A **single line** providing the move to be made: `N` `NE` `E` `SE` `S` `SW`
    `W` or `N`

## Constraints

-   0 &leq; `lightX` &lt; 40
-   0 &leq; `lightY` &lt; 18
-   0 &leq; `initialTX` &lt; 40
-   0 &leq; `initialTY` &lt; 18
-   Response time for a game round &leq; 100ms

## Synopsis

_The final battle of Ragnarök, the twilight of the gods is approaching. You
incarnate Thor who is participating in this final battle against all the forces
of evil, led by Loki, Thor's wizard brother._

_Thor was wounded during a previous battle against Fenrir, the wolf-god. During
the battle, Loki took advantage of the general confusion and used his magic to
annihilate the magical powers of Thor’s hammer, Mjöllnir, by separating it from
his soul: the light of power._

_Thor, who now feels very weak, must find and reach the light of power, as fast
as possible, since it is the only thing which can restore his and Mjollnir's
powers._
