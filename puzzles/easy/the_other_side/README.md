# The Other Side

## Goal

Placrates, the labyrinth engineer, is facing a simple puzzle. Given an
**h**×**w** grid made of **+** and **#** characters, the objective is to **count
the number of + characters in the leftmost column from which there exists a path
to the rightmost column**.

The path can be traced through a series of moves. Each move can be either
horizontal or vertical, but not diagonal. Finally, valid moves pass through
**+** characters only.

## Input

-   Line 1: The height **h** of the grid
-   Line 2: The width **w** of the grid
-   Next **h** lines: The rows of the grid, where each row is composed of **w**
    space separated characters

## Output

-   Line 1: The number of **+** characters in the leftmost column from which
    there exists a path to the rightmost column

## Constraints

-   2 &leq; **h**,**w** &leq; 12
