# Horse-Racing Duals

## The Goal

Casablanca's Hippodrome is organizing a new type of horse racing: duals. \
During a dual, only two horses will participate in the race. In order \
for the race to be interesting, it is necessary to try to select two \
horses with similar strength.

Write a program which, using a given number of strength, identifies \
the two closest strengths and shows their difference with an \
integer (>=0).

## Game Input

### Input

**Line 1:** Number **N** of horses \
**The N following lines:** the strength **P** of each horse.
**P** is an integer.

## Output

The difference **D** between the two closest strengths.
**D** is an integer greater or equal to 0.

## Constraints

1 < **N** < 100000 \
0 < **P** < 10000000
